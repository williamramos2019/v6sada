Overview
This is a full-stack personal rental and inventory management system built with React, TypeScript, and Express.js. The application helps individuals or small businesses manage equipment rentals they make from suppliers (not rentals they provide to customers) and their own warehouse/inventory control. Key features include tracking active rentals from suppliers, managing supplier relationships, monitoring personal inventory levels, and generating reports. The system uses a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for data management and includes a modern UI built with shadcn/ui components.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language. User Context: Personal/small business use - user rents equipment from suppliers rather than providing rentals to customers. Perspective: Consumer of rental services, not provider.

Recent Changes
January 2025 - Context Adaptation
System Perspective: Changed from rental provider to rental consumer
Schema Changes: Renamed "customers" to "suppliers" throughout the system
Rental Model: Updated to track equipment rented FROM suppliers
Interface Updates: Modified UI labels and terminology for consumer perspective
Dashboard: Changed "Revenue" to "Expenses" to reflect rental costs
Navigation: Updated sidebar to reflect personal use context
System Architecture
Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React 18 using TypeScript and Vite as the build tool. The application uses a component-based architecture with:

Routing: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
UI Components: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
Styling: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
Forms: React Hook Form with Zod validation
Layout: Main layout with sidebar navigation and header components
The frontend follows a page-based structure with dedicated pages for dashboard, rentals, inventory management, and reporting.

Backend Architecture
The server is built with Express.js using TypeScript and follows a REST API pattern:

Framework: Express.js with TypeScript
API Design: RESTful endpoints organized by resource (suppliers, products, rentals, etc.)
Request Logging: Custom middleware for API request/response logging
Error Handling: Centralized error handling middleware
Development: Vite integration for hot module replacement in development
Database Layer
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM:

ORM: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript schema definitions
Migrations: Drizzle Kit for database migrations and schema management
Connection: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL
Schema: Shared schema definitions between client and server
Key entities include users, suppliers (formerly customers), categories, products, rentals (equipment rented from suppliers), and inventory movements with proper foreign key relationships.

Data Access Pattern
The system implements a storage abstraction layer:

Interface: IStorage interface defining all database operations
Implementation: Concrete storage implementation (not fully visible in provided files)
Operations: CRUD operations for all entities plus specialized queries for dashboard stats, low stock alerts, and overdue rentals
Authentication & Session Management
The application includes user authentication with:

Session Storage: PostgreSQL session storage using connect-pg-simple
User Management: User entity with username/password authentication
Role-based Access: User roles for different permission levels
Development & Build System
The project uses a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript configurations:

Build: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for server bundling
TypeScript: Shared tsconfig with path mapping for imports
Development: Hot reload for both client and server
Scripts: npm scripts for development, building, and database operations
External Dependencies
Database
Neon Database: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
Drizzle ORM: TypeScript-first ORM for database operations
connect-pg-simple: PostgreSQL session store for Express
Frontend Libraries
React: Core UI framework with TypeScript
TanStack Query: Server state management and caching
Wouter: Lightweight client-side routing
React Hook Form: Form state management and validation
Zod: Runtime type validation
date-fns: Date manipulation utilities
UI Components & Styling
Radix UI: Headless UI primitives for accessibility
shadcn/ui: Pre-built component library
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework
Lucide React: Icon library
class-variance-authority: Component variant management
Build Tools & Development
Vite: Frontend build tool and dev server
esbuild: Server bundling for production
TypeScript: Type safety across the entire application
PostCSS: CSS processing with Tailwind integration
